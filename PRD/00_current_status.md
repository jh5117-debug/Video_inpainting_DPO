# Current Status

Updated: 2026-05-30

## D2 Data Readiness

The D2 generated-loser dataset is ready and must not be regenerated for the
beta10 reruns.

Root:

```text
/mnt/nas/hj/H20_Video_inpainting_DPO/data/generated_losers/official_videodpo_diffueraser_data_partialmask_loser_k4
```

Ready manifests:

| Manifest | Rows |
| --- | ---: |
| `selected_primary_comp.repaired.jsonl` | 10000 |
| `selected_primary_nocomp.repaired.jsonl` | 10000 |
| `selected_secondary_comp.repaired.jsonl` | 10000 |
| `selected_secondary_nocomp.repaired.jsonl` | 10000 |

## Old Exp5 beta500 Status

`exp5_d2_comp_k4_stage1/stage2_full` with `beta_dpo=500` and 10000-step
Stage1/Stage2 is marked **failed / collapsed / diagnostic only**.

Evidence:

- Stage2 10000 full-mask VBench qualitative outputs show visual collapse.
- Side-by-side videos show the exp5 side as high-frequency noise and color
  explosion rather than coherent inpainting.
- DPO diagnostics saturated early with `acc=1`, `dpo=0`, and `loss=0`;
  this indicates preference-objective saturation, not image quality.
- VBench showed weak downstream behavior, including `dynamic_degree=0`,
  low `overall_consistency`, and poor scene/spatial/object dimensions.

Interpretation:

- This is not a task or code-path failure.
- Exp3 showed the VideoDPO-to-DiffuEraser DPO bridge can work.
- Exp5 failed because D2 generated losers plus full-mask training, full-video
  loss, `beta_dpo=500`, no SFT regularization, and long 10000-step training
  over-optimized the preference signal and pushed the model off distribution.
- Old Exp5 must not be used as a final result. Keep it only as a failed
  ablation and diagnostic artifact.

Replacement:

| Experiment | Status | beta_dpo | Stage1 | Stage2 | Eval |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `exp5_d2_comp_k4_beta10_s1s2_4000` | planned/running | 10 | 4000 | 4000 | qual30 + full VBench |

## H20 Old Exp6 beta500 Status

Old H20 `exp6_d2_nocomp_k4_stage1_full` / beta500 training is superseded and
should be stopped if still running.

Reason:

- It has the same high-beta collapse risk exposed by old Exp5.
- It should not be continued as a final result.

Replacement:

| Experiment | Status | beta_dpo | Stage1 | Stage2 | Eval |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `exp6_d2_nocomp_k4_beta10_s1s2_4000` | planned/running | 10 | 4000 | 4000 | qual30 + full VBench |

## Current Run Policy

- Do not continue old beta500 Exp5/Exp6 long training.
- Do not regenerate D2.
- Do not restore D1 full-mask work.
- Do not modify `compute_dpo_loss`.
- Do not add SFT regularization in this rerun.
- Do not touch Exp8 region-loss settings in this pass.
- New reruns use `beta_dpo=10`, 4000 Stage1 steps, 4000 Stage2 steps, no
  validation during training, then automatic qual30 and full VBench.
